    <p>  My name is Duangkamol Khongphat but everyone calls me Guac as in Guacamole. My parents immigrated to New York City from Thailand, and only spoke Thai. So naturally, I could not speak English. My classmates and teachers had a hard time understanding me, because of the language barrier. The only way they could understand and communicate with me was through my drawings . I always had to get a piece of paper and draw everything I was talking about, just so they could understand me. </p>

<p>   As time grew, I learned to speak fluent English and no longer needed a pencil and paper. From there, I expanded my art to not only traditional art but towards digital art. When I started high school, I heard of a program called Computer Animation and Web design at Center for Technology Essex. At CTE, I taught myself the Adobe Creative Suite, Blender, Unreal 4 Engine and more. I enjoy playing with those programs and learning about them. My dream career is to become a 2d Animator for a huge company. I know there’s a long way ahead but, I’ll keep drawing and learning.  </p>
